# Deep-subspace-clustering-LDA-preprocess

This is a naive implementation of the paper [Deep Subspace Clustering with Sparsity Prior](http://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/16/Papers/275.pdf). I used Cropped YaleB dataset.

Added a linear discriminant analysis preprocessing on it

Todo: Robust-PCA approach
